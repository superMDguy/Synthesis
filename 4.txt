Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document.
Other examples include document summarization, image collection summarization and video summarization.
Document summarization, tries to automatically create a representative summary or abstract of the entire document, by finding the most informative sentences.
An example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document.
Image collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization.
Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc.
The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as "in summary" or "not in summary".
