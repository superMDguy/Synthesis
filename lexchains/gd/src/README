WELCOME!
This directory contains source code for dot and related programs. 


ABANDON ALL HOPE!
This source won't compile out of the box on a new architecture.
We distribute this code for the benefit of the research community,
but cannot afford much time to answer questions about porting
difficulties.  If you can't live with this, don't even go on.


DIRECTIONS
Edit Config.mk to select your ARCH (machine architecture) and
PREFIX (root of the installation area).

Check settings in makearch/$(ARCH).  Note here that LD is
the command to generate shared libs; LDFLAGS are passed on
the CC command line to generated executables.

ARCH can be one of:
	sgi.mips2	Silicon Graphics Irix 5 (MIPS)
	sun4		Sun SunOS 4 (SPARC)
	sol.sun4	Sun Solaris 2+ (SPARC)
	hp.pa		HP-UX (PA-RISC)
	linux.i386	Linux (x86) 
	osf.alpha	DEC OSF/1 3.0 (Alpha)
(or make a new one if necessary.)

To install everything
	make install

To clean up afterward
	make clean


COMPILING WITH NMAKE
nmake is the software configuration management utility described
in the Practical Reusable Unix Software book.  nmake Makefiles are
also provided here; they probably need fixing up in src/cmd/lefty
and src/cmd/tcldot to point to your X11 includes.
export INSTALLROOT=the directory where include/, lib/, and bin/ will be.
export ARCH=one of the choices above.
To compile and install everything
	nmake recurse install

To clean up everything
	nmake recurse clean

NOTES
	src/cmd/lefty
	    gcc seems better than cc here (e.g. provides stdarg.h for SunOS).
	    I'll be amazed if anyone else compiles this on HPUX.
	    We had to port major chunks of MIT X11 (libXaw and libXmu).

	src/cmd/tcldot
	    Requires ANSI C.
	    Requires prebuilt tcl 7.3 or 7.4
