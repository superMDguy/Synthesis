'dot' 92c

To install, run "make" in this directory.
If it succeeds, move the "dot" executable
and the man page "dot.1" to the appropriate
directories for your site.

dotguide.ps is a PostScript document.  If you can't
print it locally, try deleting the EPSF headers
(lines beginning %%).  If that doesn't work, ask
us for a paper copy.

To try an example, run

	dot -Tps examples/unix.dot -o unix.ps

Notes on the source code

While some parts of the code are reasonably clean, others
read like the engineering prototype that it is.
