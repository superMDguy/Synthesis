neato is an undirected graph embedder.

To build it, set GRAPH_DIR and DICT_DIR in makefile.
These libraries come with the 'dot' program (or
get them through ulysses!advsoft).  Run make.
You'll need an ANSI C compiler.  If this presents
a major problem, let me know and I'll send a
de-ANSIfied version of libgraph.

To try neato, give the command

	neato -Tps examples/hex.dot -o hex.ps

Then print hex.ps, or view it a PostScript previewer.

Please contact me concerning any suggestions you have
or problems you encounter.
