How to install:

* preprocessing stages (tokenization, tagging, shallow parsing)
  Code is in the directories  sgmlsent, tagger, shallow, tokenizer.
  These programs were written in PERL by Ido Dagan and Yuval, if you have
  any problems with that part contact them. It is very important to verify that
  they are installed properly before you are doing other steps.

* Lisp files + wordnet database are in WN directory. Code is written for
  Allegro Lisp. You should update pointers to the directories in the file:

  wordnet-database-files.lsp (defparameter +wordnet-database-directory+ #p"/proj/nlp/tools/lexchains/WN/") update +wordnet-database-directory+ to the
 directory where your WN database will be (currently they are in the same
 directory as lisp files, so simply write path to the dir where you put all
 the files).

 make-shallow and make-morph you should update directory for preprocessing
 tools(tagger and parser)

* to build graphs I am using tcldot (see drawgraph file in WN). You should
  check tcldot libraries to make this part running. I have some stuff in /gd,
  but maybe you should reinstall tcldot for your platform. 


How to run:

1. run allegro lisp
2. load wnlisp.lsp
3. type (doall)            (it's my makefile)
4. type (run file1)        file1 should be in the subdirectory work (it's one
                           of the program parameters, you can change it in
                           file run.lsp by changing outdir).
5. result is written to the directory work/file1_res
                           
You can see some examples of the input format in work directory (for example,
min). Every paragraph in the input text should be separated with &.
