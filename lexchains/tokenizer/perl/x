Now/RB the/DT square/NN root/NN of/IN NOT/NNP is/VBZ well/RB and/CC good/JJ ,/, but/CC what/WP we/PRP really/RB need/VBP is/VBZ a/DT square/NN root/NN of/IN Lambda./NNP &/CC It/PRP 's/VBZ important/JJ in/IN this/DT context/NN to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN Church/NNP 's/POS Thesis/NN and/CC the/DT Church/NNP -/: Turing/VBG Thesis/NN ./.

Church/NNP 's/POS Thesis/NN says/VBZ that/IN the/DT meaning/NN of/IN "/" effective/JJ computation/NN "/" is/VBZ equivalent/NN to/TO "/" all/DT computations/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB programmed/VBN in/IN Church/NNP 's/POS lambda/NN calculus/NN "/" ./. 
The/DT equivalence/NN of/IN the/DT lambda/NN calculus/NN and/CC a/DT UTM/NNP is/VBZ generally/RB assumed/VBN to/TO be/VB obvious/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB actually/RB true/JJ ./. 
A/DT UTM/NNP is/VBZ a/DT finite/JJ -/: state/NN machine/NN plus/CC a/DT tape/NN with/IN a/DT countable/JJ infinity/NN of/IN cells/NNS ,/, each/DT cell/NN containing/VBG a/DT finite/JJ set/VBN of/IN symbols/NNS ./. 
The/DT lambda/NN calculus/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ most/RBS popular/JJ form/NN with/IN mathematicians/NNS ,/, is/VBZ type/NN -/: free/JJ ,/, able/JJ to/TO operate/VB on/IN any/DT set/VBN ,/, even/RB uncountable/JJ infinities./JJ &/CC Put/VB this/DT together/RB with/IN the/DT fact/NN ,/, which/WDT goes/VBZ without/IN saying/VBG among/IN physicists/NNS ,/, that/IN quantum/NN states/NNS ,/, even/RB *after*/VBG the/DT reduction/NN of/IN the/DT wavefunction/NN ,/, are/VBP continuous/JJ values/NNS ,/, i.e./FW sets/NNS with/IN an/DT uncountable/JJ infinity/NN of/IN values/NNS ,/, and/CC you/PRP have/VBP some/DT interesting/JJ consequences./CD &/CC First/NNP of/IN all/DT ,/, even/RB before/IN quantum/NN interference/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VBP important/JJ consequences/NNS for/IN computational/JJ complexity/NN and/CC unsolvability/NN ,/, as/IN Newton/NNP and/CC Leibniz/NNP showed/VBD when/WRB they/PRP used/VBD differential/JJ calculus/NN to/TO resolve/VB the/DT famous/JJ paradoxes/NNS of/IN Zeno/NNP of/IN Elea/NNP ./. 
Zeno/NNP 's/POS theory/NN of/IN computation/NN used/VBD discrete/JJ time/NN and/CC continuous/JJ space/NN much/JJ like/IN the/DT one/CD of/IN Blum/NNP ,/, Shub/NNP and/CC Smale/NNP (/( 1989/CD )/SYM to/TO show/VB ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, that/IN "/" motion/NN is/VBZ impossible./CD "/" 
With/IN differential/JJ calculus/NN you/PRP show/VBP how/WRB the/DT limit/NN of/IN certain/JJ infinite/JJ series/NN are/VBP bounded/VBN ,/, and/CC that/IN a/DT computation/NN that/WDT may/MD not/RB halt/VB in/IN the/DT Turing/VBG model/NN if/IN the/DT target/NN of/IN Zeno/NNP 's/POS arrow/NN happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB located/VBN "/" between/IN the/DT cracks/NNS in/IN the/DT rationals/NNS "/" on/IN a/DT location/NN with/IN an/DT irrational/JJ value/NN in/IN the/DT coordinate/NN space/NN ,/, will/MD halt/VB if/IN variables/NNS can/MD be/VB real/JJ -/: valued/VBN ./. 
The/DT BlumShubSmale/NNP model/NN is/VBZ constructed/VBN over/IN any/DT ring/NN ,/, including/VBG both/DT integers/NNS and/CC reals./CD &/CC Actually/RB ,/, Zeno/NNP was/VBD using/VBG a/DT more/RBR powerful/JJ model/NN than/IN BlumShubSmale/NNP ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT computation/NN steps/NNS run/VBP faster/RBR as/IN time/NN goes/VBZ by/RB ./. 
This/DT model/NN is/VBZ discussed/VBN briefly/NN by/IN Boolos/NNP and/CC Jeffrey/NNP (/( 1980/CD )/SYM who/WP call/VBP it/PRP the/DT Zeus/NNP machine/NN ./. 
I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN unable/JJ to/TO find/VB any/DT discussion/NN in/IN the/DT literature/NN of/IN a/DT universal/JJ theory/NN of/IN computation/NN in/IN the/DT continuous/JJ ,/, Newtonian/JJ time/NN that/WDT is/VBZ used/VBN by/IN classical/JJ analog/NN computers./JJ &/CC Yet/RB in/IN quantum/NN theory/NN ,/, even/JJ time/NN is/VBZ quantized/VBN ,/, so/RB a/DT universal/JJ theory/NN of/IN continuum/NN computation/NN implementable/JJ in/IN classical/JJ physics/NN might/MD have/VB power/NN superior/JJ to/TO a/DT quantum/NN computer/NN ./. 
Quantum/NNP theory/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, provides/VBZ properties/NNS of/IN superposition/NN and/CC interference/NN that/WDT may/MD lead/VB to/TO greater/RBR computational/JJ power/NN that/IN pure/JJ continuum/NN systems/NNS ./. 
Or/CC it/PRP may/MD not/RB ./. 
I/PRP 'm/VBP inclined/VBN to/TO think/VB that/IN their/PRP$ scopes/NNS will/MD be/VB different/JJ ,/, neither/DT one/CD a/DT superset/NN of/IN the/DT other./NN &/CC Do/VBP not/RB be/VB taken/VBN in/IN by/IN blanket/NN statements/NNS of/IN computability/NN or/CC uncomputability/NN ./. 
As/IN Rogers/NNP (/( 1987/CD )/SYM discusses/VBZ in/IN great/JJ detail/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP many/JJ kinds/NNS and/CC levels/NNS of/IN uncomputability/NN ./. 
Penrose/NNP (/( 1994/CD )/SYM argues/VBZ that/IN his/PRP$ perception/NN of/IN mathematical/JJ truth/NN is/VBZ beyond/IN any/DT level/NN of/IN computability/NN ,/, even/RB an/DT infinite/JJ tower/NN of/IN Oracle/NNP Machines/NNPS ./. 
He/PRP simply/RB misunderstands/VBZ the/DT function/NN of/IN oracles/NNS in/IN computation/NN theory/NN ./. 
I/PRP use/VBP his/PRP$ argument/NN to/TO apply/VB Penrose/NNP 's/POS own/JJ book/NN as/IN an/DT input/NN to/TO his/PRP$ infinite/JJ tower/NN of/IN Oracle/NNP Machines/NNPS and/CC thereby/RB show/VBP that/IN my/PRP$ mathematical/JJ perception/NN is/VBZ superior/JJ to/TO anything/NN he/PRP may/MD write/VB ./. 
Where/WRB his/PRP$ book/NN contradicts/VBZ my/PRP$ perception/NN of/IN mathematical/JJ truth/NN (/( which/WDT it/PRP does/VBZ in/IN innumerable/JJ ways/NNS )/SYM then/RB his/PRP$ book/NN and/CC its/PRP$ Oracle/NNP argument/NN is/VBZ unargubly/RB wrong/JJ ./. 
If/IN his/PRP$ book/NN is/VBZ right/NN and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP wrong/JJ ,/, then/RB Oracle/NNP Machines/NNPS must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO capture/VB absolutely/RB any/DT computation/NN and/CC his/PRP$ argument/NN is/VBZ still/RB wrong./CD &/CC How/WRB could/MD we/PRP approach/VB a/DT theory/NN of/IN quantum/NN computability/NN as/IN an/DT extension/NN of/IN Turing/VBG computability/NN theory/NN ?/. 
One/CD way/NN is/VBZ to/TO insert/VB uncountable/JJ sets/NNS using/VBG the/DT BlumShubSmale/NNP model/NN as/IN a/DT first/JJ step/NN ./. 
We/PRP could/MD then/RB relax/VB the/DT assumption/NN of/IN discrete/JJ time/NN and/CC treat/VB the/DT UTM/NNP as/IN a/DT dynamical/JJ system/NN operating/VBG in/IN continuous/JJ time/NN ,/, attempting/VBG to/TO define/VB a/DT Universal/NNP Dynamical/NNP System/NNP that/WDT somehow/RB represents/VBZ a/DT description/NN of/IN other/JJ dynamical/JJ systems/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ state/NN space/NN ,/, and/CC proceeds/NNS in/IN time/NN by/IN following/VBG that/DT definition/NN ,/, producing/VBG identical/JJ behavior/NN to/TO a/DT system/NN implementing/VBG the/DT definition/NN directly/RB ./. 
We/PRP could/MD finally/RB attempt/VB to/TO show/VB that/DT quantum/NN theory/NN defines/VBZ a/DT particular/JJ UDS/NNP that/IN ,/, among/IN other/JJ properties/NNS ,/, includes/VBZ an/DT equivalence/NN class/NN of/IN physically/RB realizable/NNP UTMs./NNP &/CC Another/DT route/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO follow/VB the/DT "/" square/NN root/NN of/IN lambda/NN "/" idea/NN ,/, analogizing/VBG the/DT development/NN of/IN recursive/JJ function/NN theory/NN with/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN mathematics/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT square/NN root/NN required/VBD the/DT introduction/NN of/IN irrational/JJ numbers/NNS ./. 
Quantum/NNP superposition/NN of/IN computations/NNS can/MD be/VB described/VBN as/IN a/DT superposition/NN of/IN partially/RB evaluated/VBN functions/NNS ,/, with/IN interference/NN prohibiting/VBG some/DT solutions/NNS and/CC permitting/VBG others/NNS ./. 
What/WP happens/VBZ when/WRB the/DT partially/RB evaluated/VBN function/NN is/VBZ a/DT functional/JJ form/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN a/DT simple/JJ function/NN ?/. 
Is/VBZ (/( lambda/NN X/NN (/( halts/NNS X/NN )/SYM )/SYM in/IN the/DT computability/NN class/NN where/WRB this/DT works/NNS ?/. 
I/PRP think/VBP not/RB ,/, but/CC there/EX may/MD be/VB other/JJ Turing/NN -/: uncomputable/JJ functions/NNS where/WRB it/PRP does/VBZ work./CD &/CC Until/IN we/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN a/DT development/NN along/IN one/CD of/IN these/DT routes/NNS ,/, I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/VBZ safe/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN while/IN the/DT Church/NNP -/: Turing/VBG Thesis/NN may/MD be/VB problematic/JJ ,/, Church/NNP 's/POS Thesis/NN still/RB holds/VBZ ,/, and/CC that/IN computers/NNS can/MD do/VB anything/NN that/WDT is/VBZ clearly/RB and/CC precisely/RB describable/JJ ,/, including/VBG support/NN conscious/JJ systems/NNS ./. 
Theories/NNS that/WDT claim/VBP otherwise/RB are/VBP distinguishable/JJ by/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN handwaving/VBG and/CC magic/NN they/PRP involve/VBP ,/, and/CC should/MD not/RB be/VB promoted/VBN as/IN convincing./CD &/CC
