                     In Victorian time Michael Faraday gingerly
                     liquefied gase inside thick-walled glass
                     tube. By World War I, ingenuity and
                     boldness of design allowed Harvard' Percy W.
                     Bridgman to reach much higher pressure along
                     semi-industry lines. His large press
                     disclosed innumerable new phase in familiar
                     condensed matter, most famously several new
                     crystalline phase of H2O.  Eventually he came
                     to water ice VI, which at the highest
                     pressure of the time remained an ice solid
                     even at the temperature of a very hot kitchen
                     oven.

                     The price of this mastery was not low: in
                     922 a pressure container failed, steel flew
                     like shrapnel and two men were killed,
                     although the Harvard laboratory went on
                     safely for decade more. Step by step,
                     industry developed high-pressure technology
                     for large-scale synthes. The most important
                     early product was ammonia, made in the
                     million of ton by reacting hydrogen and
                     nitrogen gase at modest pressure. The most
                     celebrated is synthes diamond, by now a
                     high-pressure commodity.&
