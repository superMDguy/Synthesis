;;; Code for reading WordNet "data" and "index" files as output by WordNet's
;;; "grind" command.  These functions merely return the requested entry as a string.
;;; These are other functions which will parse those strings and extract the data.

;;; This file provides the functions INDEX-ENTRY-FOR-WORD and
;;; READ-DATA-FILE-ENTRY which are used to read raw data from WordNet's compiled
;;; database files.  You must tell them which file to read from using the
;;; FILE-DESCRIPTION argument.  You can pass a file stream (as opened by
;;; WITH-WORDNET-FILE-STREAM), a pathname or a part of speech keyword as the
;;; value for this argument.

;;; 	(INDEX-ENTRY-FOR-WORD file-description word)
;;; Looks up word in the appropriate index file and returns the string
;;; corresponding to that record of the index file.

;;;	(READ-DATA-FILE-ENTRY file-description offset)
;;; Reads a WordNet "symset" record from the specified offset in the specified
;;; file.  A string is returned.  Offset was either read from an index record,
;;; or from a pointer description in another synset record.
