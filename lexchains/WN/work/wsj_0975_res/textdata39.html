<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>A proposed conflict - of - interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high - technology new ventures , say financiers , researchers and university administrators .
<BR>    The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health - care businesses - - or lose their government money .
Among other concerns , the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new <a href = " Meanings.html#drugs"> drugs </a> .
As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years , governmental fear of abuse has risen .
<BR>    But the guidelines could " make it impossible to commercialize research , " says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
<BR>    The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15.
After that , it will make a final decision on the policy .
<BR>    The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start - up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a venture - capital firm .
With $2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone <a href = " Meanings.html#cure"> cure </a> being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
<BR>    The researchers , who are being financed by the Lithox funds , will receive a royalty , or percentage of sales , if their research yields a commercial <a href = " Meanings.html#product"> product </a> .
But because the University of California , like many other universities , shares its royalties with researchers , it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines , Mr. Daly says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The high - tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect .
For instance , Commonwealth BioVentures Inc. , a venture - capital concern , last month invested $600,000 to launch Amira Inc. , a Worcester , Mass. , concern that will produce pharmaceuticals .
Scientists Rima Kaddurah - Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
While Ms. Kaddurah - Daouk left MIT to head Amira , Prof. Schimmel will continue to work at MIT , serve on Amira 's board and own a small equity stake in the company .
<BR>    The Amira transaction is typical of the way venture - capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research .
While universities develop the basic research , " venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization , " says Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth .
" This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities. "
<BR>    But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof. Schimmel from being involved with start - ups such as Amira , venture capitalists point out .
And if that happens , the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed , they say .
<BR>    The stakes in the controversy are large .
Last year , venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start - up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses , according to the National Venture Capital Association , a trade group .
Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    In many of these deals , " venture capitalists had the inside track , " says Lawrence Bock of Avalon Ventures , La Jolla , Calif .
Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because " we had exclusive rights to those technologies , " he adds .
<BR>    But under the proposed guidelines , all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work .
" Without the exclusivity , most venture capitalists wo not have the incentive to invest in such deals , " Mr. Bock says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Last year , for example , Avalon and others invested $14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc. , South San Francisco , Calif. , to license and develop technology for delivery of <a href = " Meanings.html#drugs"> drugs </a> to the brain .
But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology , the Federal Register published most of the details , " giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it , " Mr. Bock says .
Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it .
But , says Mr. Bock , " It was a close call. "
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization - - and force small companies to waste scarce capital , entrepreneurs say .
If start - ups ca not have early access to research being conducted at institutions , " we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research , " says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern .
Duplicating research is both costly and time - consuming for a start - up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
<BR>    For its part , NIH insists that its guidelines " should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use. "
Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists , says Katherine Bick , who oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural research .
<BR>    NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures .
Not long ago , scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock .
Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a " free ride " on government - sponsored research .
A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Among other provisions , the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research .
<BR>    Ms. Bick , the NIH administrator , says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be " ideas for discussion. "
The predictions of doom are " premature , " she says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    But when agencies like the NIH circulate guidelines , they 've often already formulated policy , veteran scientists say .
Indeed , institutions already are taking note .
On Sept. 14, Harvard began circulating a conflict - of - interest policy statement that , in effect , would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully .
<BR>    The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business .
In many other institutions , scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled .
<BR>    Says Mr. Daly , the venture capitalist: " It does not matter whether they call it guidelines or policy .
The damage is already done. "
