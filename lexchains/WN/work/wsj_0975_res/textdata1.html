<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>A proposed conflict - of - interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high - technology new <a href = " Meanings.html#ventures"> ventures </a> , say financiers , researchers and university administrators .
<BR>    The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health - care <a href = " Meanings.html#businesses"> businesses </a> - - or lose their government money .
Among other concerns , the agency says researchers with <a href = " Meanings.html#business"> business </a> ties are more likely to falsify findings in <a href = " Meanings.html#order"> order </a> to tout new drugs .
As ties between academia and <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capital have blossomed in recent years , governmental fear of <a href = " Meanings.html#abuse"> abuse </a> has risen .
<BR>    But the guidelines could " make it impossible to commercialize <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> , " says Kenneth Smith , associate provost and vice president for <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
<BR>    The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15.
After that , it will make a final decision on the policy .
<BR>    The guidelines could foil future <a href = " Meanings.html#arrangements"> arrangements </a> similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc. , a Salem , Mass. , start - up , says Robert Daly , a managing partner of TA Associates , a <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> - capital firm .
With $2.3 million , he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego .
<BR>    The researchers , who are being financed by the Lithox funds , will receive a royalty , or percentage of sales , if their <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> yields a commercial product .
But because the University of California , like many other universities , shares its royalties with researchers , it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines , Mr. Daly says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The high - tech industry is full of the kind of <a href = " Meanings.html#arrangement"> arrangement </a> that the new guidelines would affect .
For instance , Commonwealth BioVentures Inc. , a <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> - capital concern , last month invested $600,000 to launch Amira Inc. , a Worcester , Mass. , concern that will produce pharmaceuticals .
Scientists Rima Kaddurah - Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
While Ms. Kaddurah - Daouk left MIT to head Amira , Prof. Schimmel will continue to work at MIT , serve on Amira 's board and own a small equity stake in the company .
<BR>    The Amira transaction is typical of the way <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> - capital firms are approaching the <a href = " Meanings.html#task"> task </a> of commercializing biotechnology <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> .
While universities develop the basic <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> , " <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization , " says Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth .
" This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities. "
<BR>    But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof. Schimmel from being involved with start - ups such as Amira , <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalists point out .
And if that happens , the entire <a href = " Meanings.html#process"> process </a> of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed , they say .
<BR>    The stakes in the controversy are large .
Last year , <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start - up companies in medical and biotechnology <a href = " Meanings.html#businesses"> businesses </a> , according to the National <a href = " Meanings.html#Venture"> Venture </a> Capital Association , a trade group .
Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    In many of these deals , " <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalists had the inside track , " says Lawrence Bock of Avalon <a href = " Meanings.html#Ventures"> Ventures </a> , La Jolla , Calif .
Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because " we had exclusive rights to those technologies , " he adds .
<BR>    But under the proposed guidelines , all federally funded <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work .
" Without the exclusivity , most <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalists wo not have the incentive to invest in such deals , " Mr. Bock says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Last year , for example , Avalon and others invested $14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc. , South San Francisco , Calif. , to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain .
But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology , the Federal Register published most of the details , " giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it , " Mr. Bock says .
Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it .
But , says Mr. Bock , " It was a close call. "
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization - - and force small companies to waste scarce capital , entrepreneurs say .
If start - ups ca not have early access to <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> being conducted at institutions , " we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> , " says Ruth Emyanitoff , manager of <a href = " Meanings.html#business"> business </a> development at Applied bioTechnology Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , concern .
Duplicating <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> is both costly and time - consuming for a start - up , Ms. Emyanitoff says .
<BR>    For its part , NIH insists that its guidelines " should not stifle <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> creativity or technology transfer from the <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> laboratory to commercial use. "
Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists , says Katherine Bick , who oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> .
<BR>    NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific <a href = " Meanings.html#ventures"> ventures </a> .
Not long ago , scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> to boost the stock .
Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a " free ride " on government - sponsored <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> .
A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential <a href = " Meanings.html#abuse"> abuse </a> from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Among other <a href = " Meanings.html#provisions"> provisions </a> , the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their <a href = " Meanings.html#research"> research </a> .
<BR>    Ms. Bick , the NIH administrator , says the <a href = " Meanings.html#business"> business </a> and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be " ideas for discussion. "
The predictions of doom are " premature , " she says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    But when agencies like the NIH circulate guidelines , they 've often already formulated policy , veteran scientists say .
Indeed , institutions already are taking note .
On Sept. 14, Harvard began circulating a conflict - of - interest policy statement that , in effect , would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully .
<BR>    The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of <a href = " Meanings.html#business"> business </a> .
In many other institutions , scientists are shunning contacts with <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> investors until the NIH policy is settled .
<BR>    Says Mr. Daly , the <a href = " Meanings.html#venture"> venture </a> capitalist: " It does not matter whether they call it guidelines or policy .
The damage is already done. "
