<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>First they get us to buy computers so we can get more <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> .
Then the computers give us more <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> than we can ever read .
Now they <a href = " Meanings.html#plan"> plan </a> to sell us products that sift through all the <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> to give us what we really want to know .
<BR>    The products range from computer - edited , personal newsletters to systems that sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires .
<BR>    " Filtered news is what people want , " says Esther Dyson , editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter that spots new developments .
" Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order to find out what they really need. "
<BR>    Geoffrey Goodfellow , who dropped out of high school back in the 1970s to manage a computer network at a California research firm , says: " Old network hands have started to turn off the network because they do not have time to wade through the muck. "
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park , Calif. , company called Anterior Technology that provides human editors for public electronic networks .
" I see it as a sewage treatment plant , " he says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    A new product , NewsEdge , carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user 's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article appears that is of interest to the user .
The product , developed by Desktop <a href = " Meanings.html#Data"> Data </a> Corp. , a new company based in Waltham , Mass. , scans the wires looking for articles that contain key words specified by the user .
<BR>    One early user , David Semmel , a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop <a href = " Meanings.html#Data"> Data </a> , says he uses it to track takeover developments .
He says he told NewsEdge to look for stories containing such words as takeover , acquisition , acquire , LBO , tender , merger , junk and halted .
" I 'm pretty confident I 'm catching everything , " he says .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    NewsEdge is pricey: $7,500 a year for a limited version , $40,000 a year if the cost of all the news wires is included .
And it works best in high - powered personal computers .
But some investors and consultants who have tried it are enthusiastic .
Jeffrey Tarter , editor of SoftLetter , a Watertown , Mass. , industry newsletter , says: " I 've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> .
This is the first time I 've seen something I could imagine a lot of people using. "
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    NewsEdge uses an FM radio band to carry news wires provided by Reuters , McGraw - Hill and Dow Jones <BR>    Co. , as well as PR Newswire , which carries corporate press releases .
An FM receiver attached to a user 's personal computer receives the <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Some organizations have devised their own systems to sort through news wire <a href = " Meanings.html#items"> items </a> as they come in .
George Goodwin , an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada , adapted a Lotus Development Corp. <a href = " Meanings.html#program"> program </a> called <a href = " Meanings.html#Agenda"> Agenda </a> to sort through international news wires .
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for <a href = " Meanings.html#reading"> reading </a> by the international bankers responsible for lending in those <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> .
<BR>    For those who do not need their personalized <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> <a href = " Meanings.html#moment"> moment </a> by <a href = " Meanings.html#moment"> moment </a> , some services are offering overnight newsletters .
<BR>    Individual Inc. , a new company in Brookline , Mass. , uses filtering technology developed by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton , to automatically produce customized newsletters it sends electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day .
<BR>    " We are operating an <a href = " Meanings.html#information"> information </a> refinery that takes a broad stream of raw <a href = " Meanings.html#data"> data </a> and turns it into actionable <a href = " Meanings.html#knowledge"> knowledge </a> , " says Yosi Amram , founder and president .
The daily newsletter , which is not widely available yet , will have a base cost of $2,000 a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters , McGraw Hill , United Press International , two press release news wires and Japan 's Kyodo news service .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    One early user is NEC Corp. 's U.S. printer marketing arm .
" They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition , " Mr. Amram says .
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC 's distributors and customers .
<BR>    Individual Inc. 's technology goes beyond word searches by using a computerized thesaurus .
If a customer asks for stories about " IBM , " the computer will also supply stories that mention " I.B.M. , International Business Machines , or Big Blue , " Mr. Amram says .
<BR>    Moreover , Individual Inc. 's computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber 's interest <a href = " Meanings.html#area"> area </a> .
It compares the position of key words in the story ; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value .
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story compared with how often they appear in the entire <a href = " Meanings.html#data"> data </a> base .
The higher the ratio of hits to total words , the higher the presumed value to the reader .
<BR>    Pinpoint <a href = " Meanings.html#Information"> Information </a> Corp. , Chantilly , Va. , a producer of $1,800 - a - year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that started full operation last month , relies on 12 human readers to code news releases by topic in order to select <a href = " Meanings.html#items"> items </a> for each subscriber .
" The computers find all the key words they can , but the editors confirm every one .
Computer picking is not perfect , " says Harvey Golomb , president and founder of Pinpoint .
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Once all the articles are coded and put in a <a href = " Meanings.html#data"> data </a> base , Pinpoint 's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three - to - five - page newsletter format ; each newsletter is sent directly from the computer to the subscriber 's fax machine .
Mr. Golomb says each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night .
<BR>    Many computer network users who never see news wires would like to sort through their electronic mail automatically .
So - called E - mail is the collection of inter - office memos , gossip , technical <a href = " Meanings.html#data"> data </a> , <a href = " Meanings.html#schedules"> schedules </a> and directives distributed over local and national computer networks .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    " All these interconnected computers make it difficult to sort out what 's junk and what 's important , " says Chuck Digate , a former Lotus Development executive who has started a new company to cope with the problem .
Mr. Digate says his firm , Beyond Inc. , has licensed technology known as <a href = " Meanings.html#Information"> Information </a> Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and <a href = " Meanings.html#plans"> plans </a> to develop it for commercial use .
<BR>    The MIT <a href = " Meanings.html#project"> project </a> devised ways for E - mail to be automatically categorized as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days .
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product " so the message will be smart enough to know to come back and bother you again next week. "
And if a user is busy , " he can set it for crisis mode: ` Do not bother me with reports until Monday. ' "
<BR>    A <a href = " Meanings.html#program"> program </a> called Notes , which is under development by Lotus , also is designed to sort E - mail sent within work groups .
One thing that makes E - mail difficult to sift through is that each <a href = " Meanings.html#item"> item </a> looks the same .
Notes , which is designed for advanced computers that display graphics , allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail .
A daily news briefing from the company librarian , for example , would have a distinctive format on the screen , just as a paper version would have .
<BR>    " With E - mail , you do not have the visual <a href = " Meanings.html#clues"> clues </a> of paper , " says Mr. Tarter , the editor of SoftLetter .
" With Notes , they 're visually distinct. "
