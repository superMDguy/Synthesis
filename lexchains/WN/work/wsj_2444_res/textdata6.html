<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Of all the one - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
<BR>    To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
<BR>    When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .
In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid - 1970s in New York .
But the reverse is also true: When a <a href = " Meanings.html#region"> region </a> 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
<BR>    Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s, as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
<a href = " Meanings.html#Area"> Area </a> employment dropped by 13% from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14%.
However , the real - estate market was hurt even more .
For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76% from the 1979 peak level .
<BR>    Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid - 1980s, real estate rebounded .
Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400% between 1982 and the peak year of 1986.
<BR>    Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?
<BR>    Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation .
Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter - cyclical play .
But now appears to be the time to act .
<BR>    Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
In the mid - 1980s, employment was down as much as 5% from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13%.
<BR>    The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
Office construction dropped 97%.
The vacancy rate soared more than 20% in nearly every product category , and more than 30% of office space was vacant .
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's " see - through skyline " were indicative of a very troubled economy .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted .
Actually , the <a href = " Meanings.html#region"> region </a> 's economy retained a firm foundation .
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years .
And personal income , after slumping in the mid - 1980s, has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .
<BR>    Today , metropolitan Houston 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> in the nation last year .
And forecasts project a 2.5% to 3% growth rate in jobs over the next few years - - nearly twice the national average .
<BR>    Denver is another metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#area"> area </a> where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the <a href = " Meanings.html#region"> region </a> 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston .
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .
Its population has continued to increase since 1983, the peak year of the economic cycle .
Employment is now 4% higher than in 1983.
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15% between 1983 and 1987 ( the most recent year available ) .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the <a href = " Meanings.html#region"> region </a> 's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years .
Housing building permits are down more than 75% from their 1983 peaks .
<BR>    Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned - - such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#area"> area </a> , and a new regional airport .
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster - - such a recovery could occur as early as next year - - business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#area"> area </a> whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?
Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid - 1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .
Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% range today may easily rise to the low to mid - 20% range in a couple of years .
Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth - - " catching cold " - - in the healthy metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
<BR>    Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan <a href = " Meanings.html#areas"> areas </a> should take a short - term ( three - year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
