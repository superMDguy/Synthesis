<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Assuming the stock market does not crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms , American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both .
" <a href = " Meanings.html#Capital"> Capital </a> City " is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television .
<BR>    The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987.
Let 's make that 1929, just to be sure .
<BR>    According to the program 's publicity prospectus , " <a href = " Meanings.html#Capital"> Capital </a> City , " set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid - sized <a href = " Meanings.html#securities"> securities </a> firm with #500 million <a href = " Meanings.html#capital"> capital </a> , " follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young , high - flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
But with all the money and glamour of high <a href = " Meanings.html#finance"> finance </a> come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second . . . "
<BR>    You need not be a high - powered <a href = " Meanings.html#securities"> securities </a> lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .
<BR>    Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right .
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's <a href = " Meanings.html#capital"> capital </a> should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
<BR>    In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .
Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today .
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy .
Ah , perfidious Columbia!
The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds ( since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? ) .
Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation .
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a loutish American , demand his resignation .
The plot is thwarted when the firm 's major stockholder , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries home to support the executive .
But the investigation continues .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously .
In fact , few consume much of anything .
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture .
Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary - colored Porsche , she has not time to clean or repair it ; the beat - up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock .
And it takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey .
<BR>    Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious Britain is not ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free - enterprise regime .
After all , this is not old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character .
Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car .
But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the masses , the script inflates pony - tailed Max into an eccentric genius , master of 11 Chinese dialects .
He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe .
<BR>    In producing and promoting " <a href = " Meanings.html#Capital"> Capital </a> City , " Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day .
The production costs are a not inconsiderable #8 million ( $12.4 million ) , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of " Dealers , " an earlier made - for - TV movie .
Another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway .
<BR>    These expenses create a special incentive for " <a href = " Meanings.html#Capital"> Capital </a> City 's " producers to flog it , or a Yank - oriented version of it , in America .
Thames 's U.S. marketing agent , Donald Taffner , is preparing to do just that .
He is discreetly hopeful , citing three U.S. comedy series - - " Three 's Company , " " Too Close for Comfort " and " Check It Out " - - that had British antecedents .
<BR>    Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution: " <a href = " Meanings.html#Capital"> Capital </a> City " should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British " Carry On " movies of the 1960s .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The seeds already are in the script .
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm .
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge ( Declan ) for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank - faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies .
<BR>    So , OK kids , everybody on stage for " Carry On Trading " : The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House .
The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa , who slaps a <a href = " Meanings.html#security"> security </a> guard .
He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering Huntz Hall 's face with microchips .
And all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper .
<BR>    It should run forever .
