<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs .
As thanks , the egg industry tried to break him .
<BR>    And the egg <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> have done a pretty good job .
They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress .
Egg - industry lobbying helped persuade six <a href = " Meanings.html#states"> states </a> to ban Mr. Maynard 's automatic egg - breaking <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> because of fears over salmonella .
His <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> , Misa Manufacturing Inc. , was <a href = " Meanings.html#forced"> forced </a> to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy <a href = " Meanings.html#law"> law </a> in 1987 and has since been liquidated .
Monthly sales of his Egg King <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> - - which he now is marketing through a new <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> - - have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75, says the 46 - year - old businessman .
<BR>    Mr. Maynard is not the first entrepreneur to bump up against entrenched interests .
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight - - it is not often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the <a href = " Meanings.html#republic"> republic </a> - - and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Now one might ask why <a href = " Meanings.html#people"> people </a> who sell eggs would fight <a href = " Meanings.html#someone"> someone </a> who is trying to make it easier to crack them .
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry .
Many larger egg <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> are also egg processors , who crack , inspect , and sanitize billions of eggs , turning them into powdered , liquified or frozen egg products .
<BR>    However , dozens of <a href = " Meanings.html#bakers"> bakers </a> , restaurant <a href = " Meanings.html#chefs"> chefs </a> and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30 - pound cans instead of shells .
But for <a href = " Meanings.html#companies"> companies </a> that use hundreds of eggs a day , breaking them by hand can get , well , out of hand .
<BR>    The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple: put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    One Egg King - - which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2 - D2 - - can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour .
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones , a big egg <a href = " Meanings.html#user"> user </a> can recover the Egg King 's $3,390 cost in a few months , says Mr. Maynard .
<BR>    Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s .
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> in the early 1970s <a href = " Meanings.html#nobody"> nobody </a> else was offering them in the U.S .
The main reason: salmonella .
<BR>    Chickens carry this bacteria , which can cause upset stomachs and , in rare cases , death among <a href = " Meanings.html#people"> people </a> .
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs , and it can also be found on unclean shells .
Thus , any <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem .
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high - grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria .
With nearly 4,000 <a href = " Meanings.html#machines"> machines </a> in use , there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed , Mr. Maynard boasts .
<BR>    He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a <a href = " Meanings.html#failure"> failure </a> to adequately cook the products .
But he says that 's no more a reason for banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    <a href = " Meanings.html#Opponents"> Opponents </a> do not buy such arguments .
" Human nature being what it is , <a href = " Meanings.html#people"> people </a> do not always follow instructions , " says Jack Guzewich , chief of food protection for the New York <a href = " Meanings.html#state"> state </a> Health Department .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    Leading the assault against the Egg King has been United Egg <a href = " Meanings.html#Producers"> Producers </a> .
The Decatur , Ga. , trade group has issued a " briefing book " that claims the <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> is " a health hazard " and that Mr. Maynard is trying " to make a fast buck at the expense of the <a href = " Meanings.html#nation"> nation </a> 's egg producers. "
The UEP declines to comment , but the group 's attorney , Alfred Frawley , says the group 's actions are motivated solely by " health concerns. "
<BR>    An early battleground was the U.S. Department of <a href = " Meanings.html#Agriculture"> Agriculture </a> .
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> to be used at egg - processing facilities regulated by the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection <a href = " Meanings.html#Service"> Service </a> .
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard , another branch of the USDA , the Agricultural Marketing <a href = " Meanings.html#Service"> Service </a> , was in charge of eggs .
After receiving complaints from egg <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> , this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval , thus limiting the <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are not regulated by the USDA .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    The egg <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration .
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg <a href = " Meanings.html#Producers"> Producers </a> said that there was " little likelihood " of a health problem as long as instructions were followed .
<BR>    So the <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> went to Capitol Hill , where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg - breaking <a href = " Meanings.html#machines"> machines </a> .
Mr. Maynard , whose <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> at the time was based in Santa Ana , Calif. , enlisted his local congressman , and the battle was joined .
<BR>    Mr. Maynard 's <a href = " Meanings.html#forces"> forces </a> finally defeated the measure , though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it .
Even then , <a href = " Meanings.html#opponents"> opponents </a> managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an " unscrupulous " method for breaking eggs .
<BR>    Foiled in their effort to get a national ban , the egg <a href = " Meanings.html#producers"> producers </a> turned their attention to the <a href = " Meanings.html#states"> states </a> .
So far , New York , New Jersey , Nebraska , Georgia , Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard 's device , citing health concerns .
<BR> <HR> <BR> <HR><BR>    An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard 's <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg <a href = " Meanings.html#Producers"> Producers </a> and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes .
The <a href = " Meanings.html#judge"> judge </a> dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard 's <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> to pay over $100,000 in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers .
Mr. Maynard says the ruling pushed his <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> into bankruptcy court .
<BR>    Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower , and started a new <a href = " Meanings.html#company"> company </a> , Adsi Inc. , to market his <a href = " Meanings.html#machine"> machine </a> .
But , so far , the change of scenery has not ended his string of bad breaks .
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .
