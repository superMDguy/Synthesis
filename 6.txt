Similarly, in image collection summarization, the system extracts images from the collection without modifying the images themselves.
The task is the following.
Keyphrases have many applications.
Another keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank.
For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram "learning" might co-occur with "machine", "supervised", "un-supervised", and "semi-supervised" in four different sentences.
Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance.
For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document.
Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular.
In any case, what the evaluation methods need as an input, is a set of summaries to serve as gold standards and a set of automatic summaries.
